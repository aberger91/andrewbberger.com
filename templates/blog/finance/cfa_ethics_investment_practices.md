####Notes & Excerpts
- The Story of Enron

- Capital flows more efficiently between investors and borrowers when market
participants are confident all parties will behave ethically. Trust is the
very foundation of the financial markets.

- Common situational influences in the investment industry that can shape thinking and behavior include money and prestige. One experiment found that simply mentioning money can reduce ethical behavior. In the experiment, participants were less likely to cooperate when playing a game if the game was called the Wall Street Game, rather than the Community Game.

- Legal behavior -> what is required; Ethical behavior -> what is morally correct

- The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal but considered by some to be unethical. Some countries, for example, do not have laws prohibiting trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, but many investment professionals and CFA Institute consider such trading unethical.

- New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely affects the markets can create opportunities for different, but similarly problematic, conduct.

- Lack of investor trust leads to higher risk premium and decreased investment capital. Reduced trust in capital markets may reduce innovation, job growth, and hurt the economy as a whole

- Standards of Professional Conduct: Professionalism, Integrity of Capital Markets, Duties to Clients, Duties to Employers, Investment Analysis Recommendations and Actions, Conflicts of Interest, Responsibilities as CFA Institute Member

- CFA members and candidates are subject to the CFA Code and Standards and applicable law. If applicable law is more strict than Code and Standards, one must follow the law.

- Standard I(B) is violated when the individual's objectivity or judgement has been compromised
