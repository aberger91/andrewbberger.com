    In this tutorial I'm going to explain how to send orders with the <code> oanda_fx_api </code> package.
    <br> <br>
    First, we are going to use the code from the previous tutorial, to get a view of the current market for the Euro.
    <br> <br>
    
    <div id='highlight'><pre>
    <code></code>
    </pre></div>
    
    <hr> <br>
    Now, say we want to place a limit order for a buy at some point lower than the current market price.
    We will need to use the OrderHandler from the oanda_fx_api to place our working order.
    <hr> <br>
    Once we create an order object, we are able to place the order, update the rate, or change the duration of the order.
    We can also pull (delete) the order by obtaining the order id and passing to to the Order.delete method.
    <hr> <br>
    
    
    If you run the following code, you should be able to view your working order from your Oanda account dashboard,
    or the Oanda GUI client that is available from their website. Oanda also has a mobile app where you are able to see
    orders, positions, and portfolio statistics.
